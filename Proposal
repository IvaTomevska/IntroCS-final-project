This is going to be the proposal for our awesome game project.
We plan to make a Star Wars themed jumping game in which Luke goes to a parralel Star Wars universe from the groind
to the death star to free Princess Leia.
On the way he collects lightsabers for points from defeated enemies (storm troopers) by jumping on them. 
If he beats them he moves on, and if not the game is lost. The score will be counted.
In the end he faces Darth Vader and "fights with him". If Luke wins hte game is won, otherwise the game is lost.
